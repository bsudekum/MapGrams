####Happenings shows you the most recent photos from Instagram given the lat long of an 'onclick' event.

#### Issues:
* ~~First click does not load photos. Must click map twice.~~
* ~~onClick does not reset with new lat long.~~
* API does not load often.  Looking into removing jquery.instagram.js

#### To-do:
* ~~Get image title below images~~
* Light box for photos onClick
* Looking to bring in Foursquare 'swarming' data
* ~~Only load 1 photo or better layour for loading many photos~~
